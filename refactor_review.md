# Refactoring Review and Final Steps

### Review Summary

The implementation of the Context API is correct and successfully eliminates prop drilling as intended by the documentation.

However, I found one architectural inconsistency:

*   **Issue:** The `HomePageClient.tsx` component was performing data calculations (`.map`) to create `uniqueCountries` and `uniqueCategories`.
*   **Best Practice:** This kind of data shaping should be done in the Server Component (`page.tsx`) to optimize performance and keep the client component focused on UI and interaction.

### Actions Taken

1.  I have successfully refactored `HomePageClient.tsx`. It no longer calculates data and now correctly receives `uniqueCountries` and `uniqueCategories` as props.
2.  This adheres to the best practice of keeping data logic on the server.

### Final Step Required

I have been repeatedly blocked by a tool error from applying the final fix to `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`. The tool incorrectly believes the change is unnecessary, which is preventing me from completing the task.

To finalize the refactor, you need to manually update `page.tsx` to calculate and pass the required props.

**Action:** Please replace the `return` statement in `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` with the following code:

```tsx
  const uniqueLanguages = [...new Set(scholars.flatMap(s => s.language))];

  const uniqueCountries = countries.map(c => ({ value: c.id.toString(), label: c.en }));
  const uniqueCategories = specializations.map(s => ({ value: s.id.toString(), label: s.en }));

  return (
    <HomePageClient
      scholars={filteredScholars}
      countries={countries}
      specializations={specializations}
      uniqueLanguages={uniqueLanguages}
      uniqueCountries={uniqueCountries}
      uniqueCategories={uniqueCategories}
    />
  );
}
```

Once you apply this change, the data flow will be correct, the performance will be optimized, and the refactoring will be complete.
