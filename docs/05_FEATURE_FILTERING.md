# Tutorial: How Filtering Works in This Project

Welcome! This tutorial will guide you through the filtering mechanism used in the "Voices of Truth" project. We use a powerful pattern that leverages Next.js Server Components for data filtering and Client Components for user interaction, with the URL acting as the "single source of truth" for the filter state.

## High-Level Overview: Server-Side Filtering

Instead of loading all scholars into the browser and filtering them there (which can be slow), we perform the filtering on the server. Hereâ€™s the basic flow:

1.  A user selects a filter option in their browser (e.g., chooses a country).
2.  The browser updates the URL to include the filter (e.g., `.../?country=Egypt`).
3.  This URL change tells Next.js to re-render the page on the server.
4.  The server reads the filter from the URL, filters the list of scholars, and sends the *already filtered* list to the browser to be displayed.

This approach is fast and efficient, especially as the number of scholars grows.

## The Data Flow: A Step-by-Step Journey

Let's trace what happens when a user filters by "Category".

### Step 1: The User Interaction (Client-Side)

The user interacts with a dropdown menu. This UI is built from a chain of components:

-   **`FilterDropdown.tsx`**: This is the core, reusable `<select>` dropdown component. When a user picks an option, its `onChange` event fires.
-   **`CategoryFilter.tsx`**: This component wraps `FilterDropdown`, providing it with the specific options for categories and a function to call when the selection changes.
-   **`FilterBar.tsx`**: This component simply organizes all the individual filter components (`CategoryFilter`, `CountryFilter`, etc.) into a single bar.

When the user selects a new category, `FilterDropdown`'s `onChange` calls the `onCategoryChange` function that was passed all the way from `HomePageClient.tsx`.

### Step 2: Updating the State and URL (Client-Side)

The main client-side logic lives in **`src/app/[locale]/HomePageClient.tsx`**.

1.  **State Management**: It uses `useState` to keep track of the currently selected filter values.
    ```typescript
    // src/app/[locale]/HomePageClient.tsx
    const [category, setCategory] = useState(searchParams.get('category') || '');
    ```

2.  **Event Handlers**: It defines functions like `handleCategoryChange` that update this state. These are the functions passed down to the filter components.
    ```typescript
    // src/app/[locale]/HomePageClient.tsx
    const handleCategoryChange = (selectedCategory: string) => setCategory(selectedCategory);
    ```

3.  **Syncing with URL**: A `useEffect` hook watches for changes in any of the filter state variables. When a change is detected, it constructs a new URL query string and uses the Next.js `useRouter` to push this new URL.
    ```typescript
    // src/app/[locale]/HomePageClient.tsx
    useEffect(() => {
      const newSearchParams = new URLSearchParams();
      if (category) newSearchParams.set('category', category);
      // ... (other filters)
      router.push(`?${newSearchParams.toString()}`);
    }, [searchQuery, country, lang, category, router]);
    ```
    This is the key step! Changing the URL triggers the server-side part of the process.

### Step 3: The Server Reacts (Server-Side)

The main page component, **`src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`**, is a **Server Component**. It runs on the server every time the page is requested.

1.  **Reading the URL**: It receives `searchParams` as a prop, which contains the filter values from the URL.
    ```typescript
    // src/app/[locale]/page.tsx
    export default async function HomePage({ params, searchParams }: HomePageProps) {
      const { query, country, lang, category } = await searchParams;
      // ...
    }
    ```

2.  **Filtering the Data**: It then uses this information to filter the main `scholars` array directly on the server.
    ```typescript
    // src/app/[locale]/page.tsx
    const filteredScholars = scholars.filter(scholar => {
      // ... filtering logic for search, country, lang ...

      const categoryId = category ? specializations.find(s => s.en === category)?.id : undefined;
      const matchesCategory = category ? scholar.categoryId === categoryId : true;

      return matchSearch && matchCountry && matchesLang && matchesCategory;
    });
    ```

### Step 4: Rendering the Result

Finally, the server component passes the filtered data down to the client component for rendering.

```typescript
// src/app/[locale]/page.tsx
export default async function HomePage(...) {
  // ... filtering happens above ...

  // Pass the *already filtered* data to the client component.
  return (
    <HomePageClient
      scholars={filteredScholars as Scholar[]}
      // ... other props
    />
  );
}
```

The `HomePageClient` receives the new, smaller list of scholars and renders it using the `ScholarList` component. The user sees an updated list of scholars that matches their selection, and the URL in their address bar reflects the current filter state.

## Summary

This "URL as State" pattern combined with Server-Side Filtering is a modern and highly effective way to build data-driven applications in Next.js.

-   **Performance**: The server handles the heavy lifting of filtering, so the client-side remains fast and responsive.
-   **Shareable URLs**: Since the filter state is in the URL, users can bookmark or share links to specific filtered views.
-   **Clean Architecture**: It creates a clear separation of concerns:
    -   **Server (`page.tsx`)**: Data fetching and filtering.
    -   **Client (`HomePageClient.tsx`)**: UI state management and user interaction.
    -   **UI Components (`Filter*.tsx`)**: Reusable and focused on presentation.
