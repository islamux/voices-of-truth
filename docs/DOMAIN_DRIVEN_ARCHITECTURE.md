# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Suggestions for Voices of Truth

Hello! As requested, here are some thoughts on how we can apply Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to our "Voices of Truth" project. This isn't a call for a massive rewrite, but rather a guide to help us build a more robust, scalable, and maintainable codebase as we move forward.

## 1. What is DDD and Why Should We Care?

In simple terms, DDD is an approach to software development that focuses on the **core domain** of the application. For us, the "domain" is all about Islamic scholars, their specializations, their content, and how users interact with them.

DDD helps us by:

-   **Creating a shared language:** Developers, designers, and anyone involved in the project can use the same terms for the same concepts.
-   **Modeling the business:** Our code structure starts to look like the real-world problem we're trying to solve.
-   **Taming complexity:** It gives us tools to break down a large, complex problem into smaller, more manageable pieces.

## 2. Core DDD Concepts & Our Project

Let's map some key DDD concepts to our project.

### a. Ubiquitous Language

This is the shared language I mentioned. We're already doing this to some extent!

-   **Scholar:** The central figure in our domain.
-   **Specialization:** A scholar's area of expertise (e.g., "Quran Interpretation").
-   **Country:** The scholar's country of origin or residence.
-   **Category:** A way to group scholars (we might need to refine this term).

**Suggestion:** Let's be very intentional about this. Every time we name a variable, a function, a component, or a file, it should use these core terms. For example, instead of `item` or `data`, we should always use `scholar`.

### b. Bounded Contexts

A Bounded Context is a boundary within which a particular domain model is defined and consistent. Think of it as a mini-application with a specific responsibility. A large application is composed of several Bounded Contexts.

For our project, we could imagine these contexts:

1.  **Scholar Profile Context:** Its job is to manage all information directly related to a scholar: their name, bio, avatar, social media links, etc.
2.  **Content Discovery Context:** This context is responsible for everything related to finding scholars. This includes searching, filtering (by country, language, specialization), and displaying lists of scholars.
3.  **Localization Context:** This context's sole responsibility is to handle translations and provide the correct language strings to the rest of the application.

**Suggestion:** We can start organizing our code around these contexts. This means grouping files related to a specific context together.

### c. Entities & Value Objects

-   **Entity:** An object defined by its unique identity, not its attributes. In our case, a **`Scholar`** is a perfect example of an Entity. Two scholars can have the same name, but they are different people with different IDs.

-   **Value Object:** An object defined by its attributes. For example, a **`Country`** or a **`Specialization`**. If the attributes are the same, the objects are the same. They don't have a unique ID.

**Suggestion:** In our `types/index.ts`, we can be more explicit about this. The `Scholar` type is an Entity. Types like `Country` and `Specialization` are Value Objects.

### d. Aggregates

An Aggregate is a cluster of domain objects (Entities and Value Objects) that can be treated as a single unit. It has a root Entity, known as the Aggregate Root.

In our project, the **`Scholar`** is the natural Aggregate Root. A `Scholar` aggregate would include the `Scholar` entity itself, plus its list of `Specialization` value objects, and other related data. Any changes to the objects within the aggregate should go through the `Scholar` root.

### e. Repositories

A Repository is a collection-like interface that provides access to all objects of a certain type. It hides the underlying data storage mechanism (e.g., a database, an API, or in our case, local files).

We are currently using our `data/scholars.ts` and the files in `data/scholars/` as a kind of repository.

**Suggestion:** We could formalize this by creating a `ScholarRepository` interface. This would define methods like `getScholarById(id)`, `getAllScholars()`, `findScholars(filter)`. Then, we can have an `InMemoryScholarRepository` that implements this interface using our current file-based data. If we ever move to a real database, we just create a new repository implementation without changing the rest of our application.

## 3. A Possible Future Folder Structure

Based on these ideas, here is a potential way we could structure our `src` directory in the future. This is just a suggestion to illustrate the concept.

```
src/
├───app/
├───components/       // Shared, generic components (Button, Input, etc.)
├───lib/
├───hooks/
└───modules/
    ├───scholar-profiles/
    │   ├───domain/
    │   │   ├───scholar.ts         // Scholar Entity, Value Objects
    │   │   └───scholar-repository.ts // Repository Interface
    │   ├───application/
    │   │   ├───get-scholar-by-id.ts // A specific use case
    │   │   └───...
    │   ├───infrastructure/
    │   │   └───in-memory-scholar-repository.ts // Implementation of the repository
    │   └───presentation/
    │       ├───ScholarCard.tsx    // UI components specific to this context
    │       └───ScholarInfo.tsx
    │
    ├───content-discovery/
    │   ├───domain/
    │   │   └───filter.ts          // Filter logic
    │   ├───application/
    │   │   └───filter-scholars.ts
    │   └───presentation/
    │       ├───FilterBar.tsx
    │       └───SearchInput.tsx
    │
    └───localization/
        └───...
```

## Conclusion

Adopting DDD is a journey. We can start small by:

1.  **Being disciplined with our Ubiquitous Language.**
2.  **Thinking in terms of Entities and Value Objects.**
3.  **Formalizing our data access with a Repository pattern.**

As the project grows, we can then start organizing our code into Bounded Contexts.

This approach will help us keep our code clean, organized, and easier to understand for everyone involved. Let me know what you think!
