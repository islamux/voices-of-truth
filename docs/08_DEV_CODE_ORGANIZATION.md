# Code Organization and Feature Suggestions

This document outlines completed refactoring tasks and suggests future improvements and features.

## Completed Refactoring

The following refactoring tasks have been successfully implemented:

*   ✅ **Server-Side Filtering:** The core filtering logic has been moved from the client to a **Server Component** (`src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`). This significantly improves performance by sending only the filtered data to the client.
*   ✅ **`ScholarCard` Componentization:** The `ScholarCard` has been broken down into smaller, more focused components: `ScholarAvatar`, `ScholarInfo`, and `SocialMediaLinks`.
*   ✅ **`FilterBar` Modularity:** The `FilterBar` has been decomposed into individual filter components (`CountryFilter`, `LanguageFilter`, `CategoryFilter`, `SearchInput`), making it more modular and extensible.
*   ✅ **Data Normalization:** The scholar data in the `/data/scholars/` directory has been updated to use `countryId` and `categoryId`, ensuring consistency with the TypeScript types.

## Future Suggestions & New Features

Here are some suggestions for new features and further improvements:

*   **Add to Favorites:**
    *   Implement a "favorite" feature allowing users to mark and save their preferred scholars.
    *   This would likely involve:
        *   A "favorite" button or icon on each `ScholarCard`.
        *   A mechanism to persist the list of favorites (e.g., using `localStorage`).
        *   A new state management hook (`useFavorites`).
        *   A UI element, such as a new filter or a dedicated "Favorites" tab, to display the saved scholars.

*   **Error Handling:** There is no explicit error handling in the server-side filtering logic. If the data files were to be missing or malformed, the application would crash. Consider adding `try...catch` blocks or other error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle these situations.

*   **Loading State:** There is no loading state in the `HomePageClient` component. When the data is being fetched and processed on the server, the user sees a blank page. Consider adding a loading spinner or skeleton loader to the `HomePageClient` component to improve the user experience.

*   **Testing Framework (High Priority):** The project currently has no automated tests, which is a critical risk for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions. A testing framework is essential for confident refactoring and future development.

    *   **Proposed Solution:** Implement a testing suite using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.

*   **Performance:** The filtering logic on the server runs on every request. For a much larger dataset, this could become a performance bottleneck. Consider looking into caching strategies or more advanced data fetching patterns.

## General Architectural Suggestions

*   **Adopt Atomic Design Principles:**
    *   Organize your components into `atoms`, `molecules`, and `organisms`. This will create a more consistent and scalable component library.
    *   **Atoms:** Basic UI elements like `Button`, `Input`, `Avatar`.
    *   **Molecules:** Combinations of atoms, like a search form (`SearchInput` + `Button`).
    *   **Organisms:** More complex components like `ScholarCard` and `FilterBar`.

By applying these suggestions, you can improve the modularity, reusability, and maintainability of your codebase.
