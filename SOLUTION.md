# Explanation of the "unstable_cacheLife" Error

## The Problem

The error message "You're importing a component that needs "unstable_cacheLife". That only works in a Server Component but one of its parents is marked with "use client", so it's a Client Component" clearly indicates the root cause.

The file `/media/islamux/Variety/JavaScriptProjects/voices-of-truth/src/app/hooks/useScholars.ts` is a client-side hook (as it uses `useState` and `useMemo`). This hook is then used by `HomePageClient.tsx`, which is explicitly marked as a Client Component (`"use client"`).

The problem arises because `useScholars.ts` imports `unstable_cacheLife` from `next/cache`. This function is a Next.js feature that is **only available on the server**. You cannot use server-only code inside a component or hook that is designated for the client.

Looking at the code for `useScholars.ts`, the imported `unstable_cacheLife` (and several other imports like `label`, `validateHeaderName`, and `VscLaw`) are not actually being used within the hook. They seem to be leftover from previous development or experimentation.

## The Solution

The solution is to remove the unused and incorrectly placed imports from `/media/islamux/Variety/JavaScriptProjects/voices-of-truth/src/app/hooks/useScholars.ts`.

The following imports were removed:

```typescript
import { label } from "framer-motion/client";
import { validateHeaderName } from "http";
import { unstable_cacheLife } from "next/cache";
import { VscLaw } from "react-icons/vsc";
```

By removing these lines, the hook no longer attempts to import server-only code, and the application can compile and run as expected. The core filtering logic of the hook remains unaffected as it did not depend on these imports.
