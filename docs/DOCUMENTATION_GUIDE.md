# A Simple Guide to Project Documentation

Hello! As a senior developer, I want to share with you a simple yet effective guide to documenting a small-to-medium-sized project like "Voices of Truth." Good documentation is like a friendly conversation with your future self and your teammates. It makes the project easier to understand, maintain, and contribute to.

## The Goal

Our goal is to create documentation that is **clear, concise, and easy to maintain**. We don't need to document every single line of code. Instead, we'll focus on the most important parts that will help a new developer get up to speed quickly.

## 1. The Core Project Files

These are the first files a new developer will look at.

### `README.md`

The `README.md` is the front door of your project. It should give a quick overview of what the project is and how to get it running.

**What to include:**

*   **Project Title:** A clear and descriptive title.
*   **Description:** A short paragraph explaining the purpose of the project.
*   **Getting Started:** The most important section! Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project locally.
    *   Prerequisites (e.g., Node.js, pnpm).
    *   Installation command (e.g., `pnpm install`).
    *   How to run the development server (e.g., `pnpm dev`).
*   **Tech Stack:** A list of the main technologies used (e.g., Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Context).
*   **Project Structure:** A brief overview of the main folders to help developers find their way around.

### `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Optional but Recommended)

If you plan to have others contribute, this file explains how.

*   How to report a bug.
*   How to suggest a new feature.
*   The process for submitting changes (e.g., pull requests).

## 2. In-Code Documentation

Good code should be as self-explanatory as possible, but sometimes a little extra context is needed.

### Comments: The "Why," Not the "What"

Avoid comments that just repeat what the code is doing.

```javascript
// Bad comment:
// Increment the counter
counter++;

// Good comment:
// We need to increment the counter here to account for the extra item
// that was added in the previous step.
counter++;
```

### JSDoc for Functions

For important or complex functions, use JSDoc comments to explain what they do, what parameters they take, and what they return.

```typescript
/**
 * Filters a list of scholars based on the provided search query.
 * @param scholars - The array of scholars to filter.
 * @param query - The search term to filter by.
 * @returns A new array of scholars that match the query.
 */
function filterScholars(scholars: Scholar[], query: string): Scholar[] {
  // ... function logic
}
```

### TypeScript as Documentation

Using TypeScript is a great way to document your code. Clear and descriptive type and interface names make it much easier to understand the data structures in your application. Always follow the established naming convention.

## 3. The `docs` Folder: Architectural & "How-To" Guides

The `docs` folder is where you can put more detailed documentation that doesn't fit in the `README.md` or in code comments.

**Suggested Documents:**

*   **`01_PROJECT_SETUP.md`**: A more detailed version of the "Getting Started" section from the `README.md`, with more explanations.
*   **`02_CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md`**: This is a very important document. It should explain the high-level architecture of the project. For "Voices of Truth," this would include:
    *   The **Server Component / Client Component** architecture.
    *   The **data flow**: how data is fetched on the server, filtered, and passed to client components.
    *   The **state management strategy**: why and how we use React Context for things like themes and filters.
*   **`03_STYLING_GUIDE.md`**: Explain how styling is handled (e.g., Tailwind CSS, global styles, CSS variables for theming).
*   **`04_FEATURE_GUIDES.md`**: Simple tutorials on how to add common features. For example:
    *   "How to Add a New Filter"
    *   "How to Add a New Page"
*   **`05_DECISION_LOG.md`** (Optional): A simple log of important decisions. For example: "We chose to use React Context for state management because it's a native solution and avoids adding extra libraries for a project of this size."

## 4. Best Practices

*   **Keep it Updated:** Out-of-date documentation is worse than no documentation. When you change a feature, take a moment to update the relevant docs.
*   **Write for Your Audience:** Write for a new developer who has never seen the project before. Avoid jargon and explain things clearly.
*   **Don't Over-Document:** You don't need to document everything. Focus on the parts of the code that are complex, important, or non-obvious.

By following this guide, you can create documentation that is a valuable asset to your project, making it a pleasure for anyone to work on.
