# Code Organization and Feature Suggestions

This document outlines completed refactoring tasks and suggests future improvements and features.

## Completed Refactoring

The following refactoring tasks have been successfully implemented:

*   ✅ **`useScholars` Hook:** Data fetching and filtering logic has been extracted from `HomePageClient` into the `useScholars` custom hook. This separates presentation logic from state management and business logic.
*   ✅ **`ScholarCard` Componentization:** The `ScholarCard` has been broken down into smaller, more focused components: `ScholarAvatar`, `ScholarInfo`, and `SocialMediaLinks`.
*   ✅ **`FilterBar` Modularity:** The `FilterBar` has been decomposed into individual filter components (`CountryFilter`, `LanguageFilter`, `CategoryFilter`, `SearchInput`), making it more modular and extensible.
*   ✅ **Data Organization:** The data in the `/data` directory has been structured into separate, linked files for scholars, countries, and specializations, improving manageability.

## Future Suggestions & New Features

Here are some suggestions for new features and further improvements:

*   **Add to Favorites:**
    *   Implement a "favorite" feature allowing users to mark and save their preferred scholars.
    *   This would likely involve:
        *   A "favorite" button or icon on each `ScholarCard`.
        *   A mechanism to persist the list of favorites (e.g., using `localStorage`).
        *   A new state management hook (`useFavorites`) or an extension of the existing `useScholars` hook.
        *   A UI element, such as a new filter or a dedicated "Favorites" tab, to display the saved scholars.

*   **Error Handling:** There is no explicit error handling in the `useScholars` hook. If the data files were to be missing or malformed, the application would crash. Consider adding `try...catch` blocks or other error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle these situations.

*   **Loading State:** There is no loading state in the `HomePageClient` component. When the data is being fetched and processed, the user sees a blank page. Consider adding a loading spinner to the `HomePage-Client` component to improve the user experience.

*   **Testing:** There are no tests in the project. Consider adding unit tests for the `useScholars` hook and the components to ensure the application is working as expected and to prevent regressions. Tools like Jest and React Testing Library would be a good choice.

*   **Code Duplication:** The `uniqueCountries` and `uniqueCategories` logic in the `useScholars` hook is very similar. This could be extracted into a reusable function to reduce code duplication.

*   **Performance:** The `filteredScholars` logic is memoized with `useMemo`, which is good. However, the `map` and `filter` operations are still performed on every render. For a larger dataset, this could become a performance bottleneck. Consider looking into more advanced techniques like virtualization or server-side filtering to improve performance.

## General Architectural Suggestions

*   **Adopt Atomic Design Principles:**
    *   Organize your components into `atoms`, `molecules`, and `organisms`. This will create a more consistent and scalable component library.
    *   **Atoms:** Basic UI elements like `Button`, `Input`, `Avatar`.
    *   **Molecules:** Combinations of atoms, like a search form (`SearchInput` + `Button`).
    *   **Organisms:** More complex components like `ScholarCard` and `FilterBar`.

By applying these suggestions, you can improve the modularity, reusability, and maintainability of your codebase.
